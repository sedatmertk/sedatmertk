- 👋 Hi, I’m @sedatmertk. Mert (prn.ed like Mart) is the preferred name that I want you to call. 
- 👀 I’m interested in coding of CSS, C++, HTML (so called XML). I'm also in love with GIMP projects, 
Basic Blender Rendering (hopefully I had my better PC which runs with it), Starter Excel and Word manipulation, 
GIT Bash command line usage (you now know why I'm here..).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C#, JS, AutoCAD, Fusion 360, SolidWorks, intermediate Arduino Projects (includes C++ in it), intermediate Excel manipulation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to forward to be a part of many projects like translating many of Mozilla's articles to own them in my mother tongue, 
contributing to develop JS projects, freecodecamp.org's preparing lessons/projects and also using light IDEs to develop big projects 
(they are not capable to do so--instead of VS Code or Visual Studio Env.s)
- 📫 To contact, do not hesitate to send e-mails to enerjiciningozunden@outlook.com 
(enerjicinin gozunden has a meaning like from the eyes of the person who concerns about energy department) for your ques and reqs. 

The main issue is to get enough funds to contribute online projects to spread informations around the world of Internet. 
And also make people understand the academics ethic when they're on computer. Significant geographies have uneducated people/developers like hackers, 
stealers of ideas of projects, using the free-shared articles to make money. These are the informations and aspects of mine shared with you.

For a person who uses GIT Bash on his other account, I had plenty of bad conditions to focus on my matters. 

I also quited my department of energy. I am now challenging to get certificates in business-technology-online certifications via skill platforms. 
There is no department or education program that I have settled in. I have a few contacts to be my guides. 
Hopefully, the visitors of this file and contacts can collaborate on significant projects. 
I went my profile and resumé with attributed them in private until I get certificates. Let's see when we are going to turn it public.

I had my environment not to render animations, slides, 3D objects with physics but develop web projects
and many of other game-engine enviromental things up to intermediate level. 
I really would like to show my certificates and succeed projects as soon as possible on my profile here and a new LinkedIN account.
